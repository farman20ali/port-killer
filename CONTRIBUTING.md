### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Installation for Development
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/farman20ali/port-killer.git
cd port-killer

# Set up the dev environment (editable install + dev dependencies)
python manage.py setup

# Run the test suite to verify
python manage.py test
```

## Code Style Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions

- Comment complex logic
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example:
```python
def find_pid(port: int) -> tuple:
    """
    Find process ID using given port
    
    Args:
        port: Port number to search for
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (pid, process_info) or (None, None) if not found
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on Windows
- [ ] Test on Linux
- [ ] Test on macOS
- [ ] Test all command flags
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test edge cases (invalid ports, etc.)

### Areas That Need Tests
- Port validation
- Process detection
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Error handling
- Edge cases

## Documentation

When adding features, update:
- `README.md` - Main documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- Docstrings in code
- Help text in argparse

## Release Process

(For maintainers)

1. Sync the version number across all package metadata files:
   ```bash
   python manage.py sync-version <version>
   ```
2. Update release documentation (e.g. create a release notes file `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_<version>.md`).
3. Commit the version updates to git:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: release version <version>"
   ```
4. Build, tag a Git release, and publish all packages:
   ```bash
   python manage.py publish --release-tag <version>
   ```
5. GitHub Actions will automatically compile binaries and attach them to the GitHub release. You can monitor progress on GitHub.
