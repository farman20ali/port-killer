# kport v3.1.1 Release Notes

**Release Date:** February 3, 2026

Bug fix release with enhanced kill strategies for stubborn processes.

---

## 🆕 What's New in 3.1.1

### Enhanced Process Termination
**The #1 requested improvement**: kport now reliably kills stubborn processes that previously wouldn't die!

- **Multi-tier kill strategy**: Automatically escalates from SIGTERM → SIGKILL → fuser
- **Automatic `fuser` fallback**: When `--force` is used and standard signals fail, kport automatically tries `fuser -k <port>/tcp` on Linux
- **Perfect for Java apps**: Solves the common problem of Java processes that ignore SIGTERM/SIGKILL
- **Zero configuration**: Works automatically when `fuser` is installed (from `psmisc` package)

**Example:**
```bash
# This now works reliably for stubborn Java/Node/Python processes!
kport kill 8081 --force
```

**Before:** `✗ Failed to kill PID 2993165 (Still running after graceful timeout)`  
**After:** `✓ Killed process(es) using port 8081 with fuser`

## 📋 Usage Examples

```bash
# Kill stubborn processes (Java, Node, Python) - now works reliably!
kport kill 8081 --force

# Install fuser for best results (one-time setup)
sudo apt-get install psmisc  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo yum install psmisc      # RHEL/CentOS/Fedora

# Regular usage still works as before
kport list
kport inspect 8080
kport kill 5000 --yes
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Python:** 3.6 or higher
- **Required:** `psutil >= 5.9.0` (for best cross-platform support)
- **Optional:** Docker CLI (for Docker features)
- **Optional:** `fuser` command (from `psmisc` package on Linux, for enhanced kill capability)

### Platform Support
- **Linux** - Full support with enhanced kill (uses `psutil` + `fuser` fallback, or `lsof`/`ss`/`netstat`)
- **macOS** - Full support (uses `psutil`, falls back to `lsof`)
- **Windows** - Full support (uses `psutil`, falls back to PowerShell/`netstat`)

### Exit Codes
- `0` - Success
- `1` - General error
- `2` - Invalid input
- `3` - Permission denied
- `4` - Port used by Docker container
- `5` - Port is free

## 🐛 Known Issues

- On some Linux systems, detecting PIDs for system services requires `sudo` or root privileges
- Docker detection requires Docker CLI to be installed and accessible in PATH
- Color output may not work on older Windows versions (< Windows 10)
- `fuser` fallback requires the `psmisc` package on Linux (install with `apt-get install psmisc`)
