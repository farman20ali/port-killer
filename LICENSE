NOTE: This is the AGPL-3.0 license, which is similar to GPL-3.0 but with
an additional requirement: If you run a modified version of this program
on a server and let users interact with it remotely through a network,
you must make the complete source code of your modified version available
to those users.

This protects against the "SaaS loophole" where companies could use the
software as a service without sharing their modifications.
