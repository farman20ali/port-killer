## 🆕 New Features

### 🎨 Cross-Platform Application Icons

kport now includes professional application icons for all platforms:

**New assets:**
- `assets/icons/windows/` — Windows `.ico` format for installers and system integration
- `assets/icons/macos/` — macOS `.icns` format for app bundles
- `assets/icons/linux/` — PNG icons in multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256)

Icons are integrated into:
- Windows installer (NSIS)
- macOS app bundle and DMG
- Linux package managers (DEB, RPM, Snap)
- VS Code extension marketplace

---

### 📦 Improved VS Code Extension Configuration

Enhanced `vscode-extension/` with:
- Refined `package.json` configuration for better marketplace visibility
- Updated icon references and branding consistency
- Improved MCP server integration documentation

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### License metadata compliance (PEP 621)

**Root cause:** `pyproject.toml` used non-standard license field format that may not be recognized by modern Python packaging tools.

**Fix:**
- Updated `project.license` to comply with PEP 621 standard
- License metadata now properly recognized by pip, poetry, and other modern tools
- Verified compatibility with setuptools 70.0+

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Improvements

Enhanced packaging workflows:
- Icon assets integrated into all package build scripts
- Improved icon path handling across platforms
- Better validation of icon formats during CI
